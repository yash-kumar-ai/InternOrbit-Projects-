About the Internship
‚Ä¢ Duration: 3 Weeks
‚Ä¢ Organization: InternOrbit
‚Ä¢ Focus Area: Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Streamlit-based Application Development
‚Ä¢ Objective: To gain hands-on experience in building ML-powered applications and data-driven tools.
Projects Overview
1.	1. Spam Message Detection App
‚Ä¢ Built a Streamlit Web App to detect whether a given message is Spam or Not Spam.
‚Ä¢ Used Naive Bayes Classifier, CountVectorizer, and Pandas for preprocessing and prediction.
‚Ä¢ Dataset: SMS Spam Collection Dataset (spam.csv)
2.	2. Global Terrorism Analysis
‚Ä¢ Analyzed the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to identify global attack trends.
‚Ä¢ Created visualizations for countries, years, and types of attacks using Plotly and Streamlit.
‚Ä¢ Implemented forecasting models to predict possible future attack patterns.
3.	3. Sign Language Video Calling App
‚Ä¢ Developed a Python-based application using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Tkinter.
‚Ä¢ Converts hand gestures to text in real-time to enable communication for the hearing-impaired.
‚Ä¢ Integrated GUI for video calling and gesture translation.
Technologies Used
‚Ä¢ Languages: Python
‚Ä¢ Libraries & Frameworks:
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
  - App Development: Streamlit, Tkinter
  - Computer Vision: OpenCV, Mediapipe, Pillow
‚Ä¢ Tools: Google Colab, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
How to Run
1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/internorbit-ml-internship.git
   cd internorbit-ml-internship

2. Install the required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit applications
   streamlit run app_name.py

4. For Jupyter or Colab notebooks, open them directly and execute the cells sequentially.
Outcomes and Learnings
‚Ä¢ Hands-on experience with Machine Learning pipelines ‚Äî from data preprocessing to deployment.
‚Ä¢ Learned to use Streamlit for building quick ML web apps.
‚Ä¢ Improved understanding of data visualization and predictive analytics.
‚Ä¢ Explored computer vision and gesture recognition for sign language interpretation.
‚Ä¢ Enhanced skills in Python, problem-solving, and model evaluation.
